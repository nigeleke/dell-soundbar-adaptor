# U2719D to AE515M Adaptor

This component is designed to connect a Dell AE515M Soundbar to the Dell U2719D monitor.

The design is based on [Dell Pro Stereo Soundbar AE515M monitor mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4672201) from M.Bartells.

The original was designed to fit to a Dell U3219Q monitor, which had did not fit cleanly to the U2719D. Its back was too high and too thick, and interfered with the cables.
